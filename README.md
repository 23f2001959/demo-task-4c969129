# Demo Task - Login Form

This project is a simple HTML and CSS login form that can be easily integrated into any web application. The login form features input fields for username and password, as well as a submit button for users to login.

## Setup

To use this login form in your project, simply download the `index.html` and `styles.css` files and include them in your project directory. You can then link the `styles.css` file in your `index.html` file to apply the styling to the login form.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

## Usage

Once you have included the necessary files in your project, you can add the login form to any webpage by including the following HTML code:

```html
<form class="login-form">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password">
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

## Code Explanation

The `index.html` file contains the HTML markup for the login form, including input fields for the username and password, as well as a submit button.

The `styles.css` file contains the CSS styling for the login form, including the colors, fonts, and layout of the form elements.
